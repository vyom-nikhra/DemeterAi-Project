# 🌱 Demeter AI: Smart Farming Solutions 🚜

Agriculture faces numerous challenges including unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and plant diseases that reduce crop yields and impact food security. **Demeter AI** bridges the gap between traditional farming and advanced technologies by providing AI-powered tools for crop management.

## 🔍 The Problem

Farming is becoming increasingly complex due to:
* **Limited access to expert advice** for small-scale farmers
* **Inefficiency in crop selection** based on local conditions
* **Lack of knowledge about appropriate fertilizers** for specific soil and crops
* **Delayed disease detection** leading to reduced productivity

## ✨ Features

### 1. 🌾 Crop Recommendation
![Crop Recommendation]

Demeter AI analyzes soil properties (NPK levels, moisture, temperature, rainfall) to suggest the most suitable crops for your specific farm conditions, ensuring optimized selection tailored to your environment.

### 2. 🧪 Fertilizer Suggestions
![Fertilizer Recommendation]

Using data on soil type, pH, temperature, and crop selection, Demeter AI provides precise fertilizer recommendations to maintain soil health, improve crop growth, and maximize yields.

### 3. 🔬 Crop Disease Detection
![Disease Detection]

With our AI-powered image recognition system, simply upload a photo of your crop to identify diseases and evaluate plant health, allowing for quick interventions to prevent widespread damage.

### 4. ☁️ Weather Integration
![Weather Forecast]

Access real-time weather data for your farm location to help plan planting, irrigation, and harvesting activities with greater precision.
